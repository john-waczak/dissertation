# 2 Vector and Tensor Fields
- Elementary physics
  - Vectors are *arrows* with direction and length 
  - They have a head *and* a tail 
  - The tail is drawn as a point *of the same space* where physics is happening
- Further investigation reveals:
  - The tail of the vector has no meaning
  - ex: Velocity $v$ means that at time $t+\epsilon$, the position becomes $r+\epsilon v$ Thus $v$ only carries local information. 
- This motivates us to think of the velocity vector as being *strictly defined at a single point*. 
  - Approach to vectors on manifolds must take this into account
  - How can we compare vectors from two different points?
